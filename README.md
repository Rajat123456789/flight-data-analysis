## **Dataset**  
📊 The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data).  
It includes:  
- 👥 Passenger demographics  
- 🎟️ Travel class and purpose  
- 🍽️ Inflight services (Wi-Fi, food, entertainment)  
- ⏳ Flight delays and satisfaction ratings  

---

## **Research Questions**  
1. Is there a significant difference in satisfaction between Business and Economy class travelers? 🏆 vs. 🛋️  
2. Does inflight Wi-Fi 📡 influence satisfaction?  
3. Are loyal customers ❤️ more satisfied than disloyal customers?  

---

## **Project Objectives**  
- 🔍 Explore customer satisfaction trends.  
- ✅ Perform hypothesis testing to validate insights.  
- 📈 Visualize patterns in satisfaction data.  
- 🛠️ Provide actionable recommendations for airlines.

## **Data Analysis Workflow**  
1. **🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and summarize statistics.  
2. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions (e.g., age, satisfaction).  
   - Analyze relationships between variables.  
3. **📊 Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Conduct t-tests and chi-squared tests to validate findings.  
4. **📈 Findings and Recommendations**  
   - Present insights with compelling visuals and statistical evidence.
